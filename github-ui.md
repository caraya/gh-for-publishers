# Github User Interface

> This article assumes that you've already created an account on Github. Other than that we'll start from scratch. 

&nbsp;

> Not all the activities in this article will apply to all types of project. We'll strive for completion in addressing everything in the UI but not all aspects of Github work for everything

When you log in to Github, you'll see something similar to the screen below.

![After Login](images/login.png)

The left side of the screen contains your social feed. Information about projects you've stared, people you've chosen to follow and information about pull requests in your projects or those you're collborating or following.

The right side of the screen has two repository listings: The top one contains repositories you've collborated on either by commenting, submitting a pull request or commenting on a PR.

The second set of repositories are those you own. You've created them and now are your responsibility. 

## What a repository look like?

I am using the repository for this project [gh-for-publishers](https://github.com/caraya/gh-for-publishers) as the model repository moving forward

## What does the repository offer?

In order to understand the repository interface, let's look at the different areas of the repository, what they do and how we can best leverage them in a publishing environment. 

### Watches, Stars and Forks

![Watches, Stars and Forks](images/social.png)

These three elements indicate the popularity of your repository.  Each one of these items has a number associated with it and indicates how many people have performed that action. From left to right:

* Watches indicate how many people are following the conversation on/about your repository
* Stars indicated how many people have starred your repository, they like it but they are not so interested in the social aspects
* Forks indicated how many people have forked or copied your repository

This information may not be relevant for smaller projects or those where you work directly with your client and no one else. Still they help measure the health of a repository and associated project. The example below is from the [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) repository.

### Information about the repository

![Information about the repository](images/information-about-repository.png)

Right above the list of files on your repository there are 4 icons. They explain your repository's status. From left to right they are:

* Number of commits: how many times has content been saved to the repository
* Number of branches: how many different branches of content exist in your repository (we'll discuss branches later in the document)
* Number of releases: how many releases have you made from the code in the repository?
* Number of collaborators: how many people are helping in the repository

## What you can do with the repo

![Repository Activities](images/repo-activities.png)

To the right of the repository window there are a series of links for activities that you can perform with your repository and/or its content. It is grouped in 5 areas. 

The first area provides tools to work with the repository content. From top to bototm:

* Code is the default view and it shows the content of your repository
* Issues list all open issues for your repository. You can also open a new issue from here
* Pull requests lists all open pull requests for the project. Pull requests are how you contribute to a project if you're not the project owner or a collaborator
* Wiki content allows you to view the content of the project's wiki and add new pages

The second block provides information about your repository

* Pulse gives you a graphical view of number of open and closes issues and pull requests
* Graph creates multiple graphics for activity in the repository

The third block controls your settings

* Settings

The fourth block provides additional ways to download your repository

* HTTPS clone URL gives the URL you can use with command line or graphical tools outside Github
* Clone in Desktop provides for a way to use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) with your repository
* Download ZIP packs the content of your repository into a zip file for download
