# Github User Interface

> This article assumes that you've already created an account on Github. Other than that we'll start from scratch. 

&nbsp;

> Not all the activities in this article will apply to all types of project. We'll strive for completion in addressing everything in the UI but not all aspects of Github work for everything

When you log in to Github, you'll see something similar to the screen below.

The left side of the screen contains your social feed. Information about projects you've stared, people you've chosen to follow and information about pull requests in your projects or those you're collborating or following.

The right side of the screen has two repository listings: The top one contains repositories you've collborated on either by commenting, submitting a pull request or commenting on a PR.

The second set of repositories are those you own. You've created them and now are your responsibility. 

## What a repository look like?

I am using the repository for this project [gh-for-publishers](https://github.com/caraya/gh-for-publishers) as the model repository moving forward

## What does the repository offer?

In order to understand the repository interface, let's look at the different areas of the repository, what they do and how we can best leverage them in a publishing environment. 

### Information about the repository

![Information about the repository](images/information-about-repository.png)

Right above the list of files on your repository there are 4 icons. They explain your repository's status. From left to right they are:

* Number of commits: how many times has content been saved to the repository
* Number of branches: how many different branches of content exist in your repository (we'll discuss branches later in the document)
* Number of releases: how many releases have you made from the code in the repository?
* Number of collaborators: how many people are helping in the repository



### Creating a repository

There are two ways to create a new repository
