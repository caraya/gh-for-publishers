# Different models and different vendors

Github is not the only alternative for hosting projects in Git, only the most popular.

Some of the other options are:

## Self Hosted

If your team is knowledgeable enough about Git, you can choose to host any of the options below on your own servers in your corporate intranet. This would make it more secure and easier to work but would preclude people outside your network from easiy accessing your Git server.

## Github

Github is the most popular Git-based hosting provider. It is more than just a hosting provider: it has become a place for building communities and a tool to develop collboartive tools and workflows.

## Bitbucket

[Atlassian Bitbucket](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket) is another offering for hosted Git software. It is meant as a companion to other Atlassian tools like Jira and Confluence rather than a stand alone product. That said, because Atlassian makes the software freeily available for unlimited repositories (both public and private) makes it an interesting atlernative.

## Gitlab

[Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) pits itself as a direct competitor to Github.
