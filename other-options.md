# Different models and different vendors

Github is not the only alternative for hosting projects in Git, only the most popular.

Some of the other options are:

## Self Hosted

If your team is knowledgeable enough about Git, you can choose to host the DVCS in your intranet. This would make it more secure and easier to work but would preclude people outside your network from easiy accessing your Git server.

## Github

Github is the most popular Git-based hosting provider. It is more than just a hosting provider: it has become a place for building communities and a tool to develop collboartive tools and workflows.

## Bitbucket

## Gitlab
