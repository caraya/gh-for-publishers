# Github Issues: A Tool for Communication

Issues were originally conceived as a means to communicate problems with the content of the repository and to engage in discussion about issues in the repository.  We can also use issues to ask question and engage in wider discussions regarding the project current status or its future. 

I've seeded two issues in the `gh-for-publishers` repository. Both have been solved yet I chose to leave one open to show what open and closed issues look like.
